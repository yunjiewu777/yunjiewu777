### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior undergraduate student at Emory University. I double major in Computer Science and Quantitative Science with Psychology tract. In the future, I plan to pursue my career as a machine learning engineer in fields like public health to make advanced techniques more accessible to health researchers and policymakers.

I'm currently collaborating with Prof. Joyce Ho and Prof. Emily Wall on research at the intersection of machine learning, information visualization and healthcare.
