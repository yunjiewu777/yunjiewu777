### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student from the Master of Computational Data Science program at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently interested in computer systems and may pursue system track for the program.

I conducted my undergraduate study at Emory University, where I double majored in Computer Science and Quantitative Science with Psychology tract, and had the chance to collaborate with Prof. Joyce Ho and Prof. Emily Wall on research at the intersection of machine learning, information visualization, and healthcare.
